Types:
    1. Singly Linked List
    2. Doubly Linked List
    3. Circular Linked List

Structure:
    1. Singly Linkedlist
        value
        node
    2. Doubly Linkedlist
        node
        value
        node

Terms:
    1. First node is called head
    2. Last node is called tail
    3. Linkedlist traversal always starts from head
    4. In Circular Linkedlist last node should point to first node in singly and both sides in doubly
