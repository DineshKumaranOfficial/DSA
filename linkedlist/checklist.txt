1. Linkedlist Concept
2. Linkedlist Types
3. Linkedlist Operations
    a. Insert
        > First
        > Last
        > Index
    b. Delete
        > First
        > Last
        > Index
    c. Search
    d. Size or length of linkedlist
    e. Print elements
4. Slow and Fast Pointer Topics
    a. Middle of linkedlist - Using Tortoise Hare Approach
    b. Detect Loop in Linkedlist - Using slow and fast pointer which is called as Floyd's algorithm
    c. Find Starting point of loop - Using Floyd's Algorithm(Using Slow and Fast pointers with another entry pointer)
    d. Find the length of the loop - Using Floyd's Algorithm
5. Intermediate Operations
    a. Reverse a Linkedlist(Iterative and Recursive)
    b. Palindrome or not
    c. Nth node from back of the list
6. Todo
    a. Intersection Point of two list
    b. Add two numbers
7. Todo Problems without notes
    a. Seggregate odd and even numbers in LL
    b. Delete the middle node
    c. Sort LL
    d. Sort 0s 1s 2s
    e. Add 1 to a number represented by LL
